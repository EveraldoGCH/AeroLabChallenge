The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app. They provided me with the base UI and API, I use it as provided and made improvements as I was doing it.

Level 1 - It works! ‚öôÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è
Make a desktop version

Each product should have a visible price in points.

Link to the project GitHub repository (footer)

The user should be able to sort products by price, from highest to lowest, and vice-versa.

The user should be able to see how many points they have in their account.

There should be a clear way for the user to distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot.

A ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù button should be available for those products that the user has enough points to claim.

A ‚ÄúRedeem now‚Äù option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim.

When the user doesn‚Äôt have enough points for a product, they should be able to see how many more points they need to claim it.

The user should not be able to redeem a product for which they don‚Äôt have enough points.

When the user clicks on the Redeem now button, the system should automatically deduct the item‚Äôs price from the users‚Äô points.

The user should be able add points to their account
